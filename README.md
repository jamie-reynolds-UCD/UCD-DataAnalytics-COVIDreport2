# UCD-DataAnalytics-COVIDreport2

### This was part two of an assignment for a data analytics module. It has data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In this analysis, we focus on using the data collected by CDC to build a data analytics solution for death risk prediction. In the previous solution I created:
- *data quality report*
- *data quality plan*
- *exploration of relationships between feature pairs*
- *creation of new features by extension, tranformation or combination of existing features*

### For this assignment I cleaned and explored the data further by exploring the correlation between features. I then discarded features that had little or no information gain, and created prediction models for the likelihood of death given feature values using:
- *linear regression*
- *logistical regression*
- *random forests*

#### Finally, I compared the performance of each model, and offered a summary of my findings.

### Instructions to use:

#### Download the entire repository, and open the "Jamie_Reynolds_19200690_COMP47350_Homework2.ipynb" file in a jupyter notebook. Run the entire notbeook. This may take some time to complete.

#### Libraries that are installed in the python virtual environment used to develop this jupyter notebook are listed in the "conda_comp47350py38_requirements.txt", "brew_comp47350py38_requirements.txt" and "pip_comp47350py38_requirements.txt" files

- This repository includes pdfs of charts that are printed throughout the report
- Also included are cleaned versions of the original csv file, and the original csv file
- There are pdfs of the data quality plan and the data quality report, which contains high-level findings about the data
